  title: "Medikons: Your Personal AI Health Assistant",
  description: "An AI-powered health assistant that translates complex medical lab results into simple, understandable Albanian, empowering users to take control of their health.",
  fullDescription: "Medical lab reports are often filled with confusing jargon, leaving people anxious and uncertain about their own health. Medikons was created to solve this problem for Albanian-speaking communities. Itâ€™s an AI-powered assistant that acts as a translator between the doctor's report and the patient. Users can securely upload their test results in any format, and the AI provides a clear, simple explanation of what each value means, highlighting anything that needs attention and suggesting the appropriate type of medical specialist to consult.",

  features: "The core of Medikons is a powerful AI engine trained to interpret and simplify complex medical terminology. We built a simple, secure interface allowing users to upload lab results in any format (PDF, photo). The system then provides clear explanations in Albanian and suggests the right type of medical specialist to consult if any values are abnormal, with data security being a top priority throughout the design.",
  impact: "Medikons directly empowers individuals by translating confusing medical reports into simple, actionable insights in their native language, fostering greater health literacy. On a broader scale, the project aimed to create an anonymized health database to support public health research in a region where such data is scarce, contributing to a healthier future for the community.",
  futureEnhancements: "The vision for the next version of Medikons is to create a personal, secure health vault. The platform will be upgraded with user profiles, allowing individuals to track their health data over time and build a comprehensive personal medical history.",

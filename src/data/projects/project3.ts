  title: "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI for Enhanced Learning in Specialized Higher Education",
  description: "Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), is increasingly integrated into student learning routines. However, general-purpose LLMs often struggle with delivering accurate, domain-specific knowledge in underrepresented languages such as Albanian. To address this, we developed Prof. Ivo, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI tool trained on the curated literature of Ivodent Academy, a dental education institution. Designed to align with students' academic needs and language preferences, Prof. Ivo demonstrated significant promise in enhancing learning experiences, especially in terms of engagement, comprehension, and trust in AI.",
  fullDescription: "Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the way students engage with their studies, influencing both learning behaviors and access to academic content. Large language models (LLMs) have become common tools in students' study routines. However, generic LLMs often underperform in highly specialized fields, particularly when it comes to delivering contextually accurate information and domain-specific terminology in underrepresented languages such as Albanian. Consequently, this draws attention to the role of educational institutions to ensure that AI tools used in academic settings provide accurate, context-aware, and accessible information. Hence, to address these limitations, we introduce Prof. Ivo, an innovative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI developed using the curated literature database of Ivodent Academy, a higher education institute focused on dental techniques. Prof. Ivo was built to address both students’ strong preference for academic content in Albanian (77.36%) and their study habits, as 39.2% reported frequent use of LLMs for academic purposes. Fifty-three student volunteers evaluated their learning experience with Prof. Ivo compared to traditional literature and a widely used general LLM (ChatGPT), across key educational criteria: understanding, focus, engagement, and text completion. In addition, the study assessed changes in students’ perceptions of AI before and after interacting with Prof. Ivo. Results showed a 23-point increase in trust in the accuracy of AI information and an 18-point reduction in concerns about AI potentially diminishing critical thinking. High scores in ease of use (87.95%) and perceived value (83.33%) further demonstrated its successful integration. In conclusion, this work highlights RAG's effectiveness in enhancing student learning and offers a compelling model for domain-specific, linguistically inclusive AI in higher education.",

  methodology: "The evaluation of Prof. Ivo was conducted through a study involving fifty-three student volunteers enrolled at Ivodent Academy. Participants interacted with three different learning resources: traditional academic literature, a widely-used general-purpose LLM (ChatGPT), and the newly developed Prof. Ivo. Their experiences were assessed across several educational dimensions, including understanding, focus, engagement, and the ability to complete academic texts effectively. Additionally, the study examined shifts in students’ perceptions of AI before and after using Prof. Ivo, particularly regarding trust in AI-provided information and concerns about AI diminishing critical thinking. Data collection was performed through pre- and post-use surveys that combined both quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback. Special emphasis was placed on evaluating the impact of linguistic accessibility, as the tool delivered content primarily in Albanian to address a significant language gap in existing AI tools.",
  results: "The findings of the study revealed notable improvements in students’ perceptions and learning outcomes following their interaction with Prof. Ivo. Trust in the accuracy of AI-generated academic content increased by 23 points, while concerns about AI diminishing students’ critical thinking abilities decreased by 18 points. The platform also scored highly in terms of usability and perceived value, with 87.95% of students reporting it was easy to use and 83.33% recognizing its overall academic value. Compared to both traditional literature and a generic LLM, Prof. Ivo fostered greater comprehension, focus, and engagement among students. These results underscore the potential of tailored RAG-based systems to bridge gaps in educational equity and content relevance.",
  nextSteps: "Building on the success of Prof. Ivo, the next steps will focus on expanding the platform's capabilities. Plans include the integration of visual content such as annotated diagrams, procedural images, and interactive modules to further enhance student understanding, particularly in visually intensive disciplines like dental techniques. Moreover, we aim to apply this RAG-based approach to other academic fields that suffer from similar limitations in domain-specific AI tools, such as veterinary science, medical imaging, and pharmaceutical technology. Future iterations will also explore cross-language expansion to support other underrepresented languages, while potential collaborations with learning management systems (LMS) will facilitate seamless academic integration. Longitudinal studies will be conducted to assess the long-term impact on learning retention and critical thinking development, reinforcing the role of AI as a supportive—not substitutive—educational tool.",

  title: "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI for Enhanced Learning in Specialized Higher Education",
  description: "A custom-built AI tutor designed to provide accurate, relevant answers in the specialized field where generic AI fails. Prof. Ivo was trained on a private university library to support students in their native language, dramatically increasing their trust and engagement with AI in learning.",
  fullDescription: "Our research showed a clear challenge: while 39% of students used AI for their studies, generic tools struggled with our specialized curriculum, and a massive 77% of students strongly preferred to learn in Albanian. To address this, I led the development of 'Prof. Ivo,' an AI tutor built on a RAG framework. Unlike generic AI, Prof. Ivo sources answers exclusively from the university's own curated library. We tested it with 53 student volunteers, and the results were definitive: trust in AI accuracy surged by 23 points, while fears of it diminishing critical thinking fell by 18 points. With an 88% ease-of-use rating, the project proved that a tailored, language-aware AI is a vastly superior educational tool.",

  methodology: "To validate Prof. Ivo, we designed a comparative study with 53 students. Each participant engaged with three learning methods: traditional literature, a generic LLM (ChatGPT), and our custom-built Prof. Ivo. Through pre- and post-use surveys, we measured key educational metrics and specifically tracked changes in perception regarding AI's trustworthiness and value, with a focus on its performance in the Albanian language.",
  results: "The study confirmed Prof. Ivo's profound impact. Trust in the accuracy of AI-generated content increased by a significant 23 points, and student concerns about AI hindering critical thinking decreased by 18 points. The platform achieved outstanding user validation scores, with 88% for ease of use and 83% for perceived academic value. These metrics provide clear, quantitative evidence that a domain-specific RAG system successfully enhances student engagement and learning outcomes.",
